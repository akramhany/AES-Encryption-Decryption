# AES-Encryption-Decryption
We are a team of first-year computer engineering students working on this project as part of our advanced logic design course. Our project involves implementing AES encryption and decryption using Verilog, a hardware description language. This project requires designing a digital circuit that can securely transmit data using the AES algorithm, and simulating and testing the circuit to ensure its accuracy and efficiency. Through this project, we aim to gain practical experience in circuit design and implementation, as well as improve our teamwork and communication skills.
